# Assignment_Management_System
In studentsâ€™ life assignments are one of the important aspects of learning and education. They help us practice, understand concepts better, and improve our skills, ultimately empowering students to succeed academically. But managing assignments can sometimes feel like a daunting task. 
                            For students, keeping track of multiple assignments can be stressful, and they might sometimes forget to submit their work or get confused about whether they have submitted it or not. For teachers, handling stacks of hard-copy assignments can be quite challenging. It's easy for papers to get mixed up or lost, turning the task into a time-consuming ordeal. The hassle of managing physical copies not only adds to their workload but also increases the risk of errors creeping in. 
                           That's why we've developed the Assignment Management System : to alleviate the burdens of manual assignment management for both educators and students, providing a more efficient solution for all.
